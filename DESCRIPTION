Description: Implements the Clustering-Informed Shared-Structure Variational Autoencoder ('CISS-VAE'), a deep learning framework for missing data imputation introduced in Khadem Charvadeh et al. (2025) <doi:10.1002/sim.70335>. The model accommodates all three types of missing data mechanisms: Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR), and Missing Not At Random (MNAR). While it is particularly well-suited to MNAR scenarios, where missingness patterns carry informative signals, 'CISS-VAE' also functions effectively under MAR assumptions.
